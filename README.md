# Covid_plotting_program
This is a program that plots data for the Covid-19 pandemic, based on inbuilt perameters

You specify a number, 'n' which will then plot countries which have more cases than 'n', equally this works with a specific date. 
For example if you gave the system, n = 10,000 and date = 06/09/2020, it would plot the countries that had greater than 10,000 by the date of 06/09/2020.

The programme has an inbuilt prediction model, that outputs a predicted value of cases, based on a linear regression model.
